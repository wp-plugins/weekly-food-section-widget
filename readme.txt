Add a food section to your sidebar. Each week, we add new articles featuring the latest food ideas, trends and kitchen-tested recipes.

== Description ==

This widget adds an automatically updating food section to your sidebar. Each week we add four or more new articles featuring the latest food ideas, trends and kitchen-tested recipes from nationally recognized corporate sponsors, commodity boards and associations.

In addition to the articles, we also include a searchable recipe database, allowing your readers to browse thousands of kitchen-tested recipes. Search from over 30 recipe course types or search by keyword. 

Lastly, we offer a way for your readers to go back and revisit hundreds of past food articles. They can go back and see what was on your food section for the last four weeks or browse from over 20 different article categories.

When your reader clicks to read one of the articles or recipes, a new window is launched with the detail, keeping your traffic on your Web site.

Use this widget to enhance your food or lifestyle blog, media site or community portal.
